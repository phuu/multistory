# multistory

## Setup, installing, building and running

### Prequisites

You need [node](http://nodejs.org) and `grunt-cli`.

To install `grunt-cli`:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### First install

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:phuu/multistory.git
cd multistory
```

And `npm` install:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running

Run the server in one terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

(or `node .`)

And build the CSS and JS using Grunt:

```bash
grunt
```

During development, you'll probably want to use `grunt watch` to automatically rebuild when things change.
